# Implement Lower Bound



### Problem statement
```
You are given an array 'arr' sorted in non-decreasing order and a number 'x'.
You must return the index of lower bound of 'x'.

```
### Note:
```
For a sorted array 'arr', 'lower_bound' of a number 'x' is defined as the smallest index 'idx' such that the value 'arr[idx]' is not less than 'x'

If all numbers are smaller than 'x', then 'n' should be the 'lower_bound' of 'x', where 'n' is the size of array.

Consider 0-based indexing.
```

### Example1
```
Input: ‘arr’ = [1, 2, 2, 3] and 'x' = 0
Output: 0

Explanation: Index '0' is the smallest index such that 'arr[0]' is not less than 'x'.
```

## Java Solution
### Approach 1 
```
public class Solution {
    public static int lowerBound(int []arr, int n, int x) {
        // Write your code here
        int low = 0;
        int high = n - 1;
        int ans = n;

        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if(arr[mid] >= x) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }   
}
```
